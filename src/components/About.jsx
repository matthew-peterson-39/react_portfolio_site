    quickly advanced to assistant manager, kickstarting my journey in leadership and team management. 
    My Air Force tenure further honed these skills, marked by early promotions, academic and fitness 
    recognitions, and the prestigious John L. Levitow Award at Airman Leadership School. As a Staff 
    Sergeant, I excelled in mentoring roles and managing complex projects, demonstrating effective 
    communication, empathy, and strategic planning. My six years of disciplined service, free from 
    any infractions and decorated with multiple Achievement Medals, reflect my dedication to excellence. 
    These experiences, though not in a technical field, have equipped me with invaluable leadership, 
    project management, and teamwork skills, readily transferable to any professional setting.
